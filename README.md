# Jorge Serrano

I design reliable automation and data platforms that connect ERP, CRM, HR, dispatch, GPS, and finance into one smooth flow. My focus is clear outcomes and low drama delivery.

## Headline wins

* **Fleet risk down**  
  Built Linxup based alerts and automated letters that reduced speeding events over 130 km per hour from **237 in July to 2 in September**.  
  Result is safer driving and fewer incident reviews.

* **Timesheet vs GPS audit**  
  Reconciles FieldEdge clock events with Linxup trips in Google Sheets, flags home clock ins and overtime, emails managers a clear summary.  
  Result is **over 100 hours saved each week** and clean payroll approvals.

* **Safety toolbox completion up**  
  Weekly reminders and follow ups from Apps Script create one concise email to the right groups.  
  Result is higher on time submissions with simple tracking.

* **Recruiting at a glance**  
  Digest and reminder system for open candidates with action buttons and audit trail.  
  Result is faster reviews and fewer stale applicants.

* **Sales to finance flow**  
  Deal to quote sync between HubSpot and Acumatica with validation and clean logging.  
  Result is consistent records and less duplicate entry.

* **Data quality you can trust**  
  Address and postal code standardization for Canadian accounts across CRM and ERP.  
  Result is near perfect search, mailing, and region reports.

## What I bring to the table

* Solution architecture for integrations among Acumatica, HubSpot, Zuper, Oracle, Humi, FieldEdge, Procore, Service Titan, Google Workspace, and custom services on Google Cloud
* Data platform and analytics with Looker Studio and Power BI, clear models and refresh schedules
* Delivery process with version control, code review rules, CI checks, and pragmatic documentation
* Team practices with mentoring, vendor selection, budget planning, and ROI tracking
* Executive communication that is simple, honest, and focused on decisions
